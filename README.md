# Path Plotter

A utility for pre plotting movement in boardgames. Right now it's being set up for a grid and offset grid for the Avalanche Press game SOPAC. 

The use will be able to click on squares and create a pre plotted path for their Naval Taskforces to follow.

It's in the early stages right now as it just imports the map and overlays the grid.
